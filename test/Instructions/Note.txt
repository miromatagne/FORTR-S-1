IF.txt :
Problems : When in the LexicalAnalyzer we put " IF " or "IF " as a identifier,
the first IF is detected but not the second one. It is because it has to have a space " " after IF, so 
if we end the line at IF directly it is normal that we don't detect it.

When " IF" it detects very well. But we cannot write IF at the first position of the line.


IFandVAR.txt :
Problems : if we write jhonIF, it will detect the VarName and the "IF".
Solution : maybe put a space in the Regex but it will cause others problems.

Remark : for "IFAbc", it will detect just the ProgName and not the 'IF'
no matter we change the order between the 2 regex {ProgrName} and "IF" in 
LexicalAnalyzer.flex

We have struggled a lot with the regex Error, because at first it detected error even with 
two words that are separated like "4gL let".
So we modify it and now it detects when : 
-a word starts with a number
-a VarName that has a upper case in it
-a ProgName that only have upper case in it

Problem : detect 1al
Detect 1Al 
But detect also 1al //
