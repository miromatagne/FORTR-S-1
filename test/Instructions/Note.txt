IF.txt :
Problems : When in the LexicalAnalyzer we put " IF " or "IF " as a identifier,
the first IF is detected but not the second one. It is because it has to have a space " " after IF, so 
if we end the line at IF directly it is normal that we don't detect it.

When " IF" it detects very well. But we cannot write IF at the first position of the line.


IFandVAR.txt :
Problems : if we write jhonIF, it will detect the VarName and the "IF".
Solution : maybe put a space in the Regex but it will cause others problems.
